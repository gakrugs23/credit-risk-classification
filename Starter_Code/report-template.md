## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge.

The purpose of this analysus was to use a mode prediction of credit risk by training the model using data from previous loans.  The information we had was loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, total debt and loan status.  What we were looking atfor was if the loan was "healthy" or if it is high risk of defaulting.  We first need to make sure the data is split into training groups and testing groups.  75% of that will be used to train and the additional 25% is used to make predictions and test the accuracy.  We will use Logistic Regression.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * When predicting healthy loans, there was a 99% precision and 100% recall.
    * When predicting high risk loans, there was a 91% precision and 85% recall.
    * Overall accuracy score was 99%

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* If the company is looking to predict which loans may be at high risk, I would recommend this model. It does a good job of doing exactly that.

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
